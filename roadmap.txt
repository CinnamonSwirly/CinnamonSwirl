Phase 1 Notes:
Check out configparser instead of using dotenv
    If we do use this, we need to initialize the config file for first-time use if it's not found.
    We'd also want to verify each value of the config is valid. Throw errors or overwrite invalid values.
        To be fair you'd have to do this anyway on an env file

Configure logging
    Do we need to sanitize strings for potential weirdness?
